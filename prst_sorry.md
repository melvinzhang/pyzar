## Counts

- Remaining `p.sorry()` sites: 40

## PR Symbol Evaluator Spikes

These are short validation tasks for the main unknowns on the PRST
evaluator path. They are not additional `p.sorry()` sites; they are meant to
decide whether the remaining proof debt stays local or expands into larger
representability work.

### Spike 1 — Boolean Helper Correctness

Goal: prove the small PR boolean helper facts once, then reuse them everywhere.

Target facts:

- `eq_nat_pr` returns `T_pt` exactly on equal nat0 inputs.
- `or_bool_pr` and `and_bool_pr` agree with the `T_pt`/`F_pt` convention.
- `T_PT_NEQ_F_PT` is available before evaluator correctness proofs consume it.

Success criterion: `is_pr_refl_pr` and `mem_t_pr` proofs can treat boolean
combinators as ordinary boolean algebra instead of expanding `if_in_sym` every
time.

### Design 2 — `is_pterm_pr` Correctness Slice

Purpose: pin the PR-level term recognizer used by reflexivity and proof-checker
examples.

Design facts:

- `is_pterm_pr Empty_pt = T_pt`.
- `is_pterm_pr (Tup_pt a b) = T_pt` from recursive `a`/`b` truth.
- `is_pterm_pr (App_pt f args) = T_pt` from `is_partial_pr_sym f` and args.
- `is_pr_refl_pr (Eq_pf t t) = T_pt` when the Eq shape is reflexive and
  `is_pterm_pr t = T_pt`.

Settled shape:

- `is_pterm_pr` is modeled as a Pair_ord course recursion returning
  `Pair_ord(is_term_bool, child_bool_pair)`, not as a direct syntax recursion.
- `Empty_pt`, `Var_pt`, `Tup_pt`, and `App_pt` have the expected boolean
  behavior. The `Tup_pt` branch consumes the two child booleans carried by the
  intermediate payload pair.
- The `App_pt` branch checks the function id with the syntactic
  `is_partial_pr_sym_pr` predicate and checks only the argument tuple through
  the payload's right child boolean.
- Representative reflexivity formulas such as `Eq_pf t t` with nontrivial
  `App_pt`/`Tup_pt` terms are accepted by `is_pr_refl_pr`; malformed non-term
  payloads and invalid App heads are rejected.

The executable reference design is `prst_pterm_spike.py`.

Production proof obligations: prove the corresponding PR evaluation lemmas for
the auxiliary course recursion, then use them to derive
`is_pr_refl_pr (Eq_pf t t) = T_pt` from the HOL-side `is_pterm t` theorem for
the representative constructor cases.

### Design 3 — `is_pr_axiom_pr` Leaf Alignment

Purpose: keep the PR checker leaf aligned with the HOL recognizer
branch-by-branch.

Branch contract:

- Direct and substituted PR-def axioms are accepted through
  `is_pr_def_instance_pr`.
- PRST reflexivity formulas such as
  `Eq_pf (App_pt adj_sym args) (App_pt adj_sym args)` are accepted through
  `is_pr_refl_pr`, guarded by `is_pterm_pr`.
- Propositional Hilbert schemas are accepted through `is_logical_axiom_pr`.

The PR-side recognizer has real bodies for the three leaves:

- `is_pr_def_instance_pr` is a disjunction of PR-level schema matchers.
  Each matcher reads schema parameters from the candidate formula, reconstructs
  the relevant PR-def template, and checks that the candidate is either the
  direct template or a one-variable `substitute_p` instance of that template.
- `is_pterm_pr` uses a Pair_ord course recursion for `Empty_pt`, `Var_pt`,
  `Tup_pt`, and `App_pt`, with App heads checked by a syntactic
  `is_partial_pr_sym_pr` shape recognizer.
- `is_logical_axiom_pr` recognizes the propositional K/S/N Hilbert schemas by
  PR-level destructuring of `Imp_pf`/`Not_pf` shapes.

`is_pr_def_instance_pr` must not search arbitrary `F,t,v < n`. Substitution can
shrink fixed `Var_pt` leaves, so a numeric bound on the pre-substitution axiom
is not a stable invariant. The settled design is schema-specific matching:

- For closed templates with no free `Var_pt` slots, accept the direct template.
- For fixed-arity schemas, destructure the candidate formula and verify each
  repeated formal slot against the extracted replacement term.
- For variable-arity schemas such as `proj_def_axiom_at i n`, read the schema
  parameters from the candidate symbol payload, check the HOL-side guard
  (`i < n`), walk the argument tuple, and verify one consistent substituted
  formal slot.
- For parametric schemas such as `rec`, `const`, `course_rec`, and `pair_*`,
  read the parameters from the candidate shape and use the same one-variable
  substitution-instance check, including nested parameter occurrences such as
  the RHS of `const_def_axiom_at c`.

The executable reference design is `prst_def_instance_spike.py`. It covers every
current `is_pr_def` axiom family: `zero`, `proj`, `if_in_true`,
`if_in_false`, `rec_base`, `rec_step`, `const`, `course_rec_base`,
`course_rec_step`, `pair_left`, `pair_right`, and `pair_ord`, including
malformed near-misses.

Production requirements: mechanise the reference design at PR level with tuple
walkers, PR-level guards such as `nat0_lt`/`is_pr_sym`, and reusable
substitution-instance checker components for schema parameters.

### Spike 4 — `substitute_pr` External Correctness Slice

Goal: prove correctness for the easy constructor cases before attempting the
full course-recursive theorem.

Target facts:

- `substitute_pr Empty_pt t v` evaluates to `Empty_pt`.
- `substitute_pr (Eq_pf a b) t v` evaluates to
  `Eq_pf (substitute_p a t v) (substitute_p b t v)`.
- One `App_pt`/`Tup_pt` example with nested arguments.

Success criterion: the full `PROV_PRST_SUBSTITUTE_EVAL` proof can be reduced
to a uniform course-recursion induction plus constructor cases, with no new
object-theory axiom.

### Spike 5 — `Proof_PRST_pr` List Checker Slice

Goal: validate the checker on the smallest proof lists before proving full
correctness.

Target facts:

- Singleton axiom list: `Proof_PRST_pr (Tup_pt a Empty_pt, a) = T_pt` when
  `is_pr_axiom_pr a = T_pt`.
- Two-line MP list: from lines `f` and `Imp_pf f g`, appending `g` validates.
- Negative empty-list case: `Proof_PRST_pr (Empty_pt, n) = F_pt`.

Success criterion: the remaining `PROOF_PRST_PR_CORRECT` proof decomposes into
`Mem_PRST`/`mem_t_pr`, `ValidProof_PRST`/`valid_proof_pr`, and the
`is_pr_axiom_pr` leaf, rather than needing a different proof representation.

Status: structurally passed. `prst_checker_spike.py` now validates the three
small cases against an executable reference model with the same final-line
first `Tup_pt` orientation as `Proof_PRST_pr`:

- singleton axiom proof lists validate from the `is_pr_axiom_pr` leaf;
- `Empty_pt` never validates as a proof list;
- a new head `g` validates by MP when the tail already contains both `f` and
  `Imp_pf f g`.

The current `Proof_PRST_pr` body in `prst_pr.py` matches this decomposition:
top-level `is_tup_pr`, head equality via `tup_head_pr`, full-list validation
via `valid_proof_list_pr`, membership via `mem_t_pr`, and MP search via
`exists_mp_witness_pr`. The remaining proof work is local evaluator API:
boolean helper correctness, Tup destructors, `mem_t_pr` correctness,
`valid_proof_list_pr` correctness, and branch correctness for
`is_pr_axiom_pr`.

One separate blocker remains for the D2/proof-combinator path:
`mp_combine_pr` in `prst_godel2.py` is still the constant-0 stub, so the
two-line checker shape is validated only for an explicit proof list, not yet
for `App_pt mp_combine_pr ...`.

### Spike 6 — Internal Evaluation Chain

Goal: check that external PR-symbol correctness can be lifted into PRST
provability without recreating HF-style representability packages.

Target examples:

- `PROV_PRST_NUMERAL_EVAL` for `0` and `SUC0 0`.
- `PROV_PRST_DIAG_EVAL` for a simple formula code.
- `PROV_PRST_SUBSTITUTE_EVAL` for a closed formula where substitution is a no-op.

Success criterion: each example follows from PR-def instances plus
`PROV_PRST_AX`, `PROV_PRST_SUBST`, `PROV_PRST_MP`, and equality reasoning,
not from a new global representability axiom.

### Spike 7 — `mu` Strength Check

Goal: verify that the current sole explicit axiom, `MU_CORRECTNESS`, is enough
for the planned proof-search witness.

Target fact:

- If `Proof_PRST_pr p n = T_pt`, then the `find_proof_pr`/`mu_sym` witness
  application also checks as a proof of `n`.

Success criterion: no leastness or totality property of `mu` is needed for G1;
only the current correctness direction is consumed.

Status: passed. `FIND_PROOF_PR_MU_CORRECT` proves the target specialization
from `MU_CORRECTNESS` alone:

```text
|- !pf n.
     App_pt Proof_PRST_pr (Tup_pt pf (Tup_pt n Empty_pt)) = T_pt
     ==> App_pt Proof_PRST_pr
           (Tup_pt (App_pt find_proof_pr (Tup_pt n Empty_pt))
                   (Tup_pt n Empty_pt)) = T_pt
```

The proof only uses `is_pr_sym Proof_PRST_pr`, the generic lift to
`is_partial_pr_sym`, `MU_CORRECTNESS`, and the definition
`find_proof_pr = mu_sym Proof_PRST_pr`.
